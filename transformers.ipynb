    "# What is NLP?\n",
    "NLP is a field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding everything related to human language. The aim of NLP tasks is not only to understand single words individually, but to be able to understand the context of those words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a list of common NLP tasks, with some examples of each:\n",
    "- **Classifying whole sentences:** Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not\n",
    "- **Classifying each word in a sentence:** Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization)\n",
    "- **Generating text content:** Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words\n",
    "- **Extracting an answer from a text:** Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context\n",
    "- **Generating a new sentence from an input text:** Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning, there are different ways to process natural language:\n",
    "- **Classification and vector spaces.** Using logistic regression, naive Bayes and word vectors to apply sentiment analysis, complete analogies and translate words.\n",
    "- **Probabilistic Models** Using dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embedding to implement autocorrection, autocompletion, and part-of-speech tag identification for words.\n",
    "- **Sequence models.** Using recurrent neural networks, LSTM, GRU and Siamese networks in Trax for sentiment analysis, text generation and named entity recognition.\n",
    "- **Attention models.** One of these deep learning models are `transformers`, which we will explain in detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP isn't limited to written text though. It also tackles complex challenges in speech recognition and computer vision, such as generating a transcript of an audio sample or a description of an image."

    "## Why is it challenging?\n",
    "Computers don't process information in the same way as humans. For example, when we read the sentence \"I am hungry\", we can easily understand its meaning. Similarly, given two sentences such as \"I am hungry\" and \"I am sad\", we're able to easily determine how similar they are. For machine learning (ML) models, such tasks are more difficult. The text needs to be processed in a way that enables the model to learn from it. And because language is complex, we need to think carefully about how this processing must be done. There has been a lot of research done on how to represent text, and we will look at some methods in the next chapter."

    "# Transformers\n",
    "In machine learning, a transformer is a specific type of deep learning model that excels at natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It was introduced in a 2017 research paper titled \"Attention is All You Need\" [arxiv.org].\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what makes transformers unique:\n",
    "- **Attention mechanism:** Unlike traditional models that process data sequentially, transformers use an attention mechanism. This allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input data (like words in a sentence) that are relevant to the current task.\n",
    "- **Parallel processing:** By using the attention mechanism, transformers can consider all parts of the input data simultaneously. This makes them faster to train compared to sequential models.\n",
    "- **Encoder-decoder architecture (for some tasks):** Transformers can be used in an encoder-decoder architecture for tasks like machine translation. In this setup, the encoder processes the source language, and the decoder generates the target language translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have become a foundational block for various NLP tasks, including:\n",
    "- Machine translation\n",
    "- Text summarization\n",
    "- Question answering\n",
    "- Text generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Their ability to understand complex relationships within sequences of data makes them powerful tools in the field of NLP."

    "## Working with pipelines\n",
    "The most basic object in the 🤗 Transformers library is the pipeline() function. It connects a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps, allowing us to directly input any text and get an intelligible answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, this pipeline selects a particular pretrained model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis in English. The model is downloaded and cached when you create the classifier object. If you rerun the command, the cached model will be used instead and there is no need to download the model again.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main steps involved when you pass some text to a pipeline:\n",
    "- The text is preprocessed into a format the model can understand.\n",
    "- The preprocessed inputs are passed to the model.\n",
    "- The predictions of the model are post-processed, so you can make sense of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the currently available pipelines are:\n",
    "- sentiment-analysis\n",
    "- zero-shot-classification\n",
    "- text-generation\n",
    "- fill-mask\n",
    "- ner (named entity recognition)\n",

This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don’t have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You’ve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels — but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like.\n",
